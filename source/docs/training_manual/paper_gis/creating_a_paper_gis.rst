Developing a Paper GIS 
=======================

Paper GIS
Before computers, geographers used a paper GIS to analyse patterns in the landscape. 
Different map features were traced and overlaid on top of each other. This allowed 
geographers to remove map features that were not important for their studies.

Paper GIS still used today by researchers and landscape architects:

* Basic GIS concepts can be demonstrated using overlays of sheets of paper.

* In a computer GIS you will need to make sure the layers are at the same projection 
and scale and that the data is geo-referenced.

* Geo-referencing may involve shifting, rotating, scaling, skewing, and in some areas 
warping or orthorectifying the data.

* When you trace data from the same map for a paper GIS, your layers will be automatically 
referenced correctly.

Useful Hint: Have the following equipment available for a paper GIS task

* Coloured pen or pencils.

* Tracing paper or thin blank paper.

* Masking tape or sticky tape

* Ruler

Task: Creating a paper GIS
---------------------------

Refer to the topographic map of Thabazimbi and the Fact File.

Fact file: Mining in Thabazimbi

* Thabazimbi mine produces primarily high-grade haematite ore (more than 62% iron content).
 
* Current mining activities take place in three pits, using conventional opencast methods.

* 1. Use tracing paper or thin blank paper and trace all the rivers in blue.  Head this the
“rivers layer”.	
* 2. On another sheet of paper trace the 1 200 m contour line in brown and shade in the land 
above 1 200 m. Label this layer  “high relief”.

* 3. On another sheet of paper trace and label all the mine excavations and slimes dams in red. 
Label this the “mining layer”.

* 4. Overlay the “river layer” on top of the “relief layer” and comment on how relief influences 
drainage pattern. (Grade 12)

* 5. Overlay the “river layer” on top of the “mining layer”.  (Grade 12)
  * a. Highlight the river segments that have their source at a mine excavation. These would be 
the rivers that environmentalists would most likely monitor for quality.

  * b. Discuss how mining in the area has influenced river drainage.

Practice questions (Exam style)

Use the same layer traces as for the sample question above. (Grade 12)

* 1.	Label a radial, dendritic and trellis drainage pattern on the “river” layer. (3)

* 2.	Indicate the watershed or drainage divide on the “relief” layer.	(2)

* 3.1	Label with an X on the “relief layer” a possible location for the photographer who took 
        the photograph below:(2)

    * 1.2 Indicate by means of an arrow next to the X the likely direction the photographer was looking 
          when they took the photograph.		(2)
* 4.1	Draw a 500m “buffer” zone around each excavation on the “mining layer”. 	(4)

* 4.2	Overlay the “river layer” on the “mining layer” and count how many first order streams are within 
        500m of a mine excavation.		(4)

* 4.3	Imagine Anglo American wished to open another opencast mining operation in the area. Use the GIS layers 
        that you have generated and the topographic map extract to fine the best location for this new mine. 
        Indicate the new mine on the “mining layer” in black. Note the following environmental restrictions.
        
        * Assume that iron ore is only found above 1 200 m.
        
        * The mine may not be visible from the town of Thabazimbi.

        * The mine may not be within 500 m of a stream.

        * The mine may not be located in a nature reserve.
        
        * The mine has to be within 4 km of a railway line to be economically viable to transport the iron ore.	(10)

Note: a GIS consultant would be able to give Anglo American a number of possible locations in a few minutes using 
a computerised GIS.
